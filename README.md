# Big Data Processing

This repo holds all of my course work for **Big Data Processing (IE494)**.

## Structure

```bash
big-data-processing
└── map-reduce-programs
    ├── Lab-1
    ├── Lab-2
    └── Lab-3
└── spark-rdd-programs
    └── Lab-4
// more labs/topics will be added soon!

```

*(I’m still working through the course and adding more as I go — feel free to explore what’s there already!)*

## How to use

1. Browse through the `<topics>/Lab- <n>` folders.
2. Inside each, run the code according to the setup instructions or the file comments.
3. New labs or topics will land in that `<topics>` folder as I progress.

## Contribute / Collab
Feel free to **fork** the repo and add new programs, suggest changes, comment, or open a **PR** — I’ll review and merge useful contributions.
